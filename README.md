<sub> ~~^ i couldnt find the artist frowns~~ </sub>

# byi

no dni, follow your own. ill ignore/block you if i feel the need to

if you dont have proship dni, you cant get mad if i int with you :// pls i beg i like talking to people

i overthink and read into EVERYTHING. im awful at reading people, and im also a people pleaser. please iwc at all times and use tonetags with me!

i dont really have my own personality so i tend to copy people. i act very differently around different people. i always try to be nice though PLS lmk if im bothering you or something. i wont be offended if you just tell me

im not scary!! pls dont hesitate to interact w me. im more scared of you than you are of me /silly . if you like fnaf and or aftoncest bmf giggles /nf

pretty much the only fandom im in/i care about is fnaf/dsaf. i wont get your references /lh

im problematic, dni/block if you dont like that. im proship, profic and pro non-harmful paras (strictly anti-c for harmful paras)

i dark/comship to cope. i dont really want to talk about shipcourse

im an [evertween](https://www.tumblr.com/search/evertween?src=recent_search). however, i am almost bodily an adult

im a gregory (fnaf sb & [tftpp](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Gregory_(Tales_from_the_Pizzaplex))) irl. im a semisharing yumeshipper. i ship myself with evan afton. i am NOT a map etc - im not attracted to irl kids. genuinely stop calling me this, its extremely upsetting (targeted)

he/him and masc terms. xenogender hoarder. objectum romantic, platonic and familial. fictoromantic, platonic and familial. sex repulsed hypersexual. undisclosed para(s).  questioning others

while i dont really have a dni, i want "freeshippers" and pro-harassment antis to stay away from me. i dont agree with or support radqueers and am uncomfy with you all. iwec or just dni

syscourse dni. im not a system, and dont know my stance on any of that

dont reality check me or tell me to "get help". im AWARE im not gregory irl or in an irl relationship with evan. im GETTING HELP. dont assume things about me. also, its none of your business! (targeted)

  <summary>for ex friends:</summary>
you know who you are: please delete my name from all of your socials, especially public ones, such as your pinterest. im not going to interact with your pin anyways. you dont need to be bringing our PERSONAL drama into public spaces like this. please delete what you have about me on your strawpage. a lot of it is misinformation. please stop spreading this shit about me. youre crossing a boundary. im genuinely sorry if i crossed any of yours but that doesnt make this right. /
  
you know who you are: stop trying to contact me. what youre doing is disgusting and i dont know why youre bringing me into this. it isnt my drama and it isnt my business. i seperated myself from you all a long time ago. because of what youre doing there are rumors that were friends again. i dont want to be associated with ANY of you. please stop and work on your mental health, the way youre acting is concerning and worrying /gen 

you know who you are: thank you for checking up on me. i genuinely appreciate it. when you contacted me i was doing especially bad, and reading through the messages again i realize i sounded a bit not ok. sorry. i hope youre doing well but please stay away from me from now on. 

ill delete all of this soon. i just want this drama to be over with atp, its been over a month. im sorry i hurt you all. but the amount of uninvolved people youve involved makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. </details>
